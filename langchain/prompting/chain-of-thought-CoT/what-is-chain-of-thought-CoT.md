## What is Chain of Thought (CoT)?

Chain of thought (CoT) is a method that forces the LLMs to reason through a series of steps.

**The goal** is to break down complex tasks into smaller, interconnected subtasks, allowing the LLM to address each
subtask in a step-by-step manner.

**Another significant advantage** of CoT in the improved interpretability and transparency of the LLM-generated response.
By offering insights into the model's reasoning process, we, as users, can better understand and qualify how the final 
output was derived, which promotes truth in the model's decision-making abilities.
